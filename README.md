## About the Project
Four bright software engineers designed and built Jumpy Kart over a week. A proposal was drafted, which included a database schema, a sample-state, timeline, and frontend and backend routes. The work was equally divided and the timeline was systematically followed from start to finish, to create an exciting and playable game.
